# Telegram QR Code Generator Bot

This project is a Telegram bot developed using Python and the aiogram library. The bot generates QR codes from text prompts and provides users with QR code images. It offers a convenient way to quickly generate QR codes for various purposes directly within the Telegram messaging platform.

## Features

- Generates QR codes from text prompts.
- Provides users with QR code images.
- Works within the Telegram messaging platform for easy access.

## Technologies Used

- Python: Used to write the bot's logic and handle QR code generation.
- aiogram: A Python library for building Telegram bots, providing convenient APIs for interacting with the Telegram Bot API.
- pyqrcode: A Python library for generating QR codes.

## Usage

To use the Telegram QR Code Generator Bot, follow these steps:

1. Find and start the bot by searching for it on Telegram or using the bot's username [@text_to_QR_Generator](https://t.me/text_to_QR_Generator_bot).
2. Enter the desired text prompt or command to generate a QR code.
3. The bot will generate a QR code image based on the provided input.
4. Download or save the QR code image shared by the bot.

## Project Structure

└── README.md
```

- `app.py` contains the code for setting up the Telegram bot using aiogram and handling user interactions and contains the code for generating QR codes from text prompts.
- `requirements.txt` lists the dependencies required to run the bot.
- `README.md` provides information about the project.

## Setup Instructions

To set up and run the Telegram QR Code Generator Bot, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the project files to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the `app.py` file and replace the placeholders with your Telegram Bot API token and other necessary configurations.
5. Run the bot by executing the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```
6. Find and start the bot on Telegram and start generating QR codes.

Note: Ensure you have a valid Telegram Bot API token before running the bot. You can obtain a token by creating a new bot through the BotFather on Telegram.
